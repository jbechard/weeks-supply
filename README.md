# weeks-supply

The Weeks of Supply report was a consolidation of data from multiple sources, including SQL Server, INFORMIX, and Oracle databases, as well as text files. The `Process` subfolder in this repo contains the files that prepared the data, with the output being a text file that would be fed into a SQL Server database. The Excel file would then read the data from SQL Server with a query table, and a formatting macro would format the table.
